/**
   @defgroup filedialog LV2_FileBrowser_Files
   @ingroup lv2

   A feature for LV2 plugins to provide sample files (or other selectable files) within the plugin's resource bundle to host file selection dialogs.

   Browser directories may contain actual files that typically have been uploaded by users; but may also contain symlinks to files
   in other locations. This feature allows plugins to publish files within the plugin's resource bundle to browser directories. For 
   each published file consists of a symlink in the browser directory that links to a corresponding file in the plugins resource bundle.

   The LV2_FileBrowser_Files.publish_resource_files() method allows plugins to publish entire directories. publish_resource_files() 
   implements a versioning system, which tracks whether sample files have been deleted by the user. If the symlink for sample files that were installed
   by a previous version of the plugin have been deleted, the sample files from the current version are not reinstalled. See LV2_FileBrowser_Files.publish_resource_files.
   not re-installed.

   See: <http://rerdavies.github.io/pipedal/TBD XXX.html> for more details.

     This function can be used by plugins to get the path of files or directories

     The primary purpose of this method is to map file references to files in the plugin's bundle
     directory to corresponding files in the a file browser directory.

     If the path is relative, the full path is resolved using the `rootResourceDirectory` path.

     If the full path is not a child of rootResourceDirectory or if the path is relative,
     get_upload_path returns the supplied path unmodified.
`
     If the filename is a child of rootResourceDirectory, creates a corresponding link to the file in the file browser 
     directory and returns the path of that link.
