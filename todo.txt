ToobFreeverb has a big memory leak!

Convert subscribers to shared_ptr's.

Do we have to deactivate both Audio handles after an underrun? I think so.

Back Button sequence for performance view.

Review state changing code. Do we need this anymmore? I think not.


Review current handleNotifyPatchProperty. I tink server-side support needs to be
removed, and rely on handleNotifyPathPatchPropertyChanged instead.

private handleNotifyPatchProperty(clientHandle: number, instanceId: number, propertyUri: string, jsonObject: any) {

Midi bindings.    

SEGV at void PiPedalModel::OnNotifyMaybeLv2StateChanged(uint64_t instanceId)
            bool changed = this->audioHost->UpdatePluginState(*item);
            PiPedalModel.cpp:375

       because audioHost is gone.
       revamp shutdown procedure for the audio thread. 
       write a marker on exit, and don't  release 
       audioHost UNTIL the service thread has read the close marker.
       
- continuing corrupt memory.
- LV2 STATE and properties DO NOT MATCH in saved files.
- LV2_STATE is not populated wiht properties are.
- properties are not popluate when LV_sate Is.
- FINISH PATH property running updates code.
  Maybe we should be using LV2_State (if we can capture it  
  propertly. ) 
         



- verify that scanning doesn't cause overruns.
- verify address change behaviour in client
-verify clean removal of dhcpcd and nm_p2p2d

X Review docs changes once we go live.

- Localisation: support non-UTF8 code pages.
- unicode commandline arguments.
- review unicode filenames (this is probably ok)

- BUG: gcs when we have an animated output control
