Review current handleNotifyPatchProperty. I tink server-side support needs to be
removed, and rely on handleNotifyPathPatchPropertyChanged instead.

`private handleNotifyPatchProperty(clientHandle: number, instanceId: number, propertyUri: string, jsonObject: any) {

Midi bindings.    


       revamp shutdown procedure for the audio thread. 
       write a marker on exit, and don't  release 
       audioHost UNTIL the service thread has read the close marker.
       

-verify clean removal of dhcpcd and nm_p2p2d

X Review docs changes once we go live.

- Localisation: support non-UTF8 code pages.
- unicode commandline arguments. (probably the hotspot name)
- review unicode filenames (this is probably ok)

- BUG: gcs when we have an animated output control
