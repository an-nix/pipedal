ToobFreeverb has a big memory leak!

Review state changing code. Do we need this anymmore? I think not. It is a bit sus.


Review current handleNotifyPatchProperty. I tink server-side support needs to be
removed, and rely on handleNotifyPathPatchPropertyChanged instead.

`private handleNotifyPatchProperty(clientHandle: number, instanceId: number, propertyUri: string, jsonObject: any) {

Midi bindings.    

SEGV at void PiPedalModel::OnNotifyMaybeLv2StateChanged(uint64_t instanceId)
            bool changed = this->audioHost->UpdatePluginState(*item);
            PiPedalModel.cpp:375

       because audioHost is gone.
       revamp shutdown procedure for the audio thread. 
       write a marker on exit, and don't  release 
       audioHost UNTIL the service thread has read the close marker.
       
- continuing corrupt memory.


- verify that scanning doesn't cause overruns.
- verify address change behaviour in client
-verify clean removal of dhcpcd and nm_p2p2d

X Review docs changes once we go live.

- Localisation: support non-UTF8 code pages.
- unicode commandline arguments.
- review unicode filenames (this is probably ok)

- BUG: gcs when we have an animated output control
