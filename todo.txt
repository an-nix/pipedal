- Test midi bindings.

    -- Toggle
    -- Switch
    -- List 
    -- Dial.

-- make sure trigger controls are set to default value after load/save.

- reset trigger controls after processing.
- reset triggers before loading.
- review trigger binding behavior.
- triggers dont' change save state.
- Feature for directory locations.


- center ellipsis on file properties.

- State of MIDI plugins:
   - plugin routing is implemented. (maybe needs a not-cheating UI)
   - MIDI message routing is not.
   - No routing of midi messages yet. 
   - Midi Channel Filter dialog is implemented, but not yet hooked up. 
   - Need to think about Midi Channel filters for system and control bindings. A separate filter?
   - Bunch of new LV2 interfaces probably needed -- most especially program selection.
   - SF2 plugin loads the SF2 file on the Scheduler thread, blocking everyone else fo sevearl seconds. Completion
   - becomes a SIGNIFICANT issue, since it's going to leak upward of 1G of memory!
   - Severe memory trash/state trash of the SF2 plugin in LV2 restore state. (starts complaining about DBus notification failures!)
   - Suspect the bin64 library which has several buffer overrun problems.


X Start and end connectors are missing in PedalboardView when no device selected (Do they have zero outputs?)
X Review docs changes once we go live.

- Localisation: support non-UTF8 code pages.
- unicode commandline arguments. (probably the hotspot name)
- review unicode filenames (this is probably ok)

- BUG: gc problems when we have an animated output control on phones only.
