&nbsp;

PiPedal running on a Raspberry Pi 4 or Pi 5 provides stable super-low-latency audio via external USB audio devices, or internal Raspberry Pi audio hats.

PiPedal can be remotely controlled via a web interface over Ethernet, or from your phone or tablet via Wi-Fi Direct. Set up and configure the Wi-Fi Direct interface via the browser interface.

Install the [PiPedal Remote Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.twoplay.pipedal) to get one-click access to PiPedal via Wi-Fi Direct. Or connect from PC, Laptop or your Raspberry Pi via a web browser over Ethernet. You can set up and configure the Wi-Fi Direct connection from the browser interface.

PiPedal's user interface has been specifically designed to work well on small form-factor touch devices like phones or tablets. Clip a phone or tablet on your microphone stand on stage, and you're ready to play! Or connect via a desktop browser, for a slightly more luxurious experience. The PiPedal user-interface adapts to the screen size and orientation of your device, providing easy control of your guitar effects across a broad variety devices and screen sizes.

PiPedal includes a pre-installed selection of LV2 plugins from the ToobAmp collection of plugins; but it works with most LV2 Audio plugins. There are literally hundreds of free high-quality LV2 audio plugins that will work with PiPedal. Just install them on your Raspberry Pi, and they will show up in PiPedal.  

If your USB audio adapter has MIDI connectors, you can use MIDI devices (keyboards, controllers, or midi floor boards) to control PiPedal while performing. A simple interface allows you to select how you would like to bind PiPedal controls to midi messages.
