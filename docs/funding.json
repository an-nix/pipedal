PiPedal is controlled remotely via a web application, or using the Android PiPedal Remote app.\n\nPipedal's user interface has been specifically designed with Phone and Tablet user interfaces in mind. Clip your phone or tablet onto a microphone stand, plugin your Raspberry Pi, and you're set to play!\n\nPiPedal started as  Pandemic Project. I spent two years developing PiPedal full time during the pandemic. I would very much like to continue working on it full time, but I need your help to do so.",
