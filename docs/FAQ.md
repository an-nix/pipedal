### Q. Dial control movements are too coarse. How do I make them finer?

A. If you are using a desktop browser, the Ctrl and Shift keys modify the behaviour of the dial control.
If you press the Shift key while you are dragging the control, the values will change in 10x smaller increments.
If you press the Ctrl key while you are dragging the control, the values will change in 50x smaller increments.

It's fine to use your home Wi-Fi network to connect to PiPedal when you're at home; but don't forget that when you take PiPedal out to a gig, you will need to ensure that PiPedal's Wi-Fi auto-hotspot is enabled before you do.
