## System Requirements

{% include pageIcon.html %}

* A Raspberry PI 5, PI 4B or PI 400, with at least 2GB of RAM to run (4GB recommended). PiPedal will run on a PI 3, but you will not be able to use some plugins due to excessive CPU use.
* To build PiPedal, at least 8GB of RAM is required.
* An external USB Audio Adapter, or a Pi audio hat with at least one audio input, and one audio output.

PiPedal has been tested on the following Operating Systems:

* Raspberry Pi OS 64-bit Bookworm

Older versions of PiPedal (v1.1.31) have been tested on the following operating systems:

* Ubuntu 21.04 or later, 64-bit
* Raspberry PI OS 64-bit Buster

Compatibility testing on these OS's for current versions of PiPedal is ongoing.

64-bit operating systems are preferred, as they delivery significantly higher performance than 32-bit platforms.
